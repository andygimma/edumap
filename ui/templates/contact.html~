<h3>We need your help! Datasets and expertise wanted.</h3>
<p>If we are going to make this a truly useful website, we will need contributions from as many people as we can manage. That means we need datasets of people, places, and organizations that belong on an education resource map. It also means we are looking for people who want to participate in building this website. Developers, designers, people who like to play with statistics, make graphs, and really anything else you want to build.</p>
<p>To make this a great site, we need your ideas and your participation, so please don't hesitate to email.</p>
