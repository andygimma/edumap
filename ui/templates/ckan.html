<h3>Efficient and Open Store Data Archive</h3>
<p>CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) is used to power official data portals by national and local governments in the UK, Brazil, the Netherlands, Austria, the US, and elsewhere, as well as by other organisations and data communities wanting to publish or collaborate with data. The DataHub, where data can be freely registered or uploaded, is used by organisations including the British Library and the scientific journal Nature. It powers over 40 data hubs around the world.</p>
<p>We want to make sure this data is widely used. Especially when we expand beyond New York City. To that end, we want to build a partnership from the beginning that allows us to put that data somewhere useful.</p>
